Repository for Course work (Assignments and Project) on ATU Module **25-26: 8640 -- Web Services and Applications**   
</br>
This repository is dedicated to the weekly assignments handups for module 25-26: 8640 -- Web Services and Applications   
To avoid issues of submission, I have kept this repository separate from the Projects work for this Module.

## Assignments  
* Each file in 'assignments' folder is clearly named according to Assignment Number   
* The files maybe jupyter notebooks or Python files that provide solutions to the assigned taak for that week.
